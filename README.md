   *(Future updates will transition to cloud-based databases.)*
2. **Connection String**: Add the provided connection string to your project's User Secrets.
3. **Google Cloud Storage Credentials**:
   - Unzip the `CredentialsGStorage_UnzipHere.zip` file.
   - Place the extracted files in the `wwwroot` directory.

### First Run

1. Run the application; it will automatically create the database and tables.
2. Register the first user as a "Manager" to initialize the system.
3. Optionally, activate the seeder to populate the database with sample data.
4. Start using PMSWeb with all features enabled.
